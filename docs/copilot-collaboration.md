**Helpful:** Generated semantic HTML matching my poem

### Adding Copied Button

**Mode:** Agent
**Why this mode:** It needed to add to the already established HTML and CSS as well as create new files. Throughout the process I had the AI adjust the script and files to my specifications, as well as make adjustments on my own.
**Helpful:** Set the foundation for the copy button and helped make a js script to facilitate that purpose.

### Developing Comment Section

**Helpful:** Gave me multiple methods of execution and provided the information I really needed.
