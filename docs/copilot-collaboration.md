# Copilot Collaboration Log

## Quick Summary

- Which mode did you use most? [Agent]
- Most helpful Copilot moment: [When I asked it to help me refine the HTML structure I build, and expanded it with other HTML files that integrate with the main page.]

## Key Interactions (3-5 entries)

### Setting up the project

**Mode:** Ask
**Why this mode:** Needed to build a game plan for the project and find a starting point
**Helpful:** Created a great starting point and even helped me set up files that will be important for meeting the specs.

### Creating HTML structure

**Mode:** Agent
**Why this mode:** Ready to build after planning
**Helpful:** Generated semantic HTML matching my poem

### Adding Copied Button

**Mode:** Agent
**Why this mode:** It needed to add to the already established HTML and CSS as well as create new files. Throughout the process I had the AI adjust the script and files to my specifications, as well as make adjustments on my own.
**Helpful:** Set the foundation for the copy button and helped make a js script to facilitate that purpose.

### Adding Conjoined HTML Pages

**Mode:** Agent
**Why this mode:** Gathering information so I know how to integrate multiple HTML pages using a navigation menu at the top of the page. This was crucial to making the user experience better.
**Helpful:** Gave me multiple methods of execution and provided the information I really needed.

## What I Learned

- **Ask vs Agent:** Use Ask to understand, Agent to build
- **Best discovery:** [Something Copilot taught you]
- **Next time:** [One thing you'd do differently]
