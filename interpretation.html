      <h1>Interpretation</h1>
      <p>There are many ways to interpret "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening". Some see it as a meditation on nature and solitude, while others view it as a reflection on life and death.</p>
      
      <p>This is reflected by the actions of the former Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau's son, who used an edited version of the poem for his fathers funeral.</p>

      <p>More personally, I find the poem introspective. It invites the reader to pause and reflect on their own life choices and the inevitable passage of time.</p>
        
      <p>The final stanza is of particular interest to me. This really cements the concepts of life and death well over the whole poem. The idea of "miles to go before I sleep" signifies the responsibilities and commitments that remain before one can find peace.</p>
